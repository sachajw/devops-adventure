# Fine dining with Abraham Ortelius
## Canapes
## Operating Systems
### Windows
- `Windows 10` latest version & fully updated
- Enable `WSL2` | Go to `Programs and features` --> `Turn Windows features on or off` --> `Windows Subsystem for Linux`
- We recommend using a second disk if you have one in your machine to create the custom folder to house the VMDK
- This splits up the I/O between the Windows OS and WSL2 which is just a stripped down virtual machine
- Install Windows Terminal [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install) for easier management and get familiar with the documentation
- Use this [documentation](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-ubuntu-2110-wsl-windows-10-and-11) to install the latest `Ubuntu` flavour, don't bother with the Microsoft store ( We recommend `Ubuntu Jammy JellyFish` at this time of writing)
- Line feed ending hell can be solved with [Dos2Unix](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/dos2unix.htm)
- Windows uses CRLF
- Linux uses LF
- This [Stackoverflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2920416/configure-bin-shm-bad-interpreter) can help you understand whats going on
- Example error `/bin/sh^M:bad interpreter`
- VSCode extension to fix this headache [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vs-publisher-1448185.keyoti-changeallendoflinesequence)
- Suggestion Alert: Set your `VSCode` to `LF` and only use `WSL2` to do all your work

## Configs for WSL
#### Windows Operating System
`c:\Users\Ortelius\.wslconfig`
```
# Settings apply across all Linux distros running on WSL 2
[wsl2]

# Limits VM memory to use no more than 4 GB, this can be set as whole numbers using GB or MB
memory=4GB

# Sets the VM to use two virtual processors
processors=2

# Specify a custom Linux kernel to use with your installed distros.
# The default kernel used can be found at https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel
#kernel=C:\\temp\\myCustomKernel

# Sets additional kernel parameters, in this case enabling older Linux base images such as Centos 6
#kernelCommandLine = vsyscall=emulate

# Sets amount of swap storage space to 8GB, default is 25% of available RAM
swap=4GB

# Sets swapfile path location, default is %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp\swap.vhdx
swapfile=D:\\wsl\\ubuntu-22-04-lts\\wsl-swap.vhdx

# Disable page reporting so WSL retains all allocated memory claimed from Windows and releases none back when free
pageReporting=false

# Turn off default connection to bind WSL 2 localhost to Windows localhost
localhostforwarding=true

# Disables nested virtualization
nestedVirtualization=false

# Turns on output console showing contents of dmesg when opening a WSL 2 distro for debugging
debugConsole=true
[user]
default = sacha

[automount]
options = "metadata"

# Limits VM memory to use no more than 4 GB, this can be set as whole numbers using GB or MB
memory=4GB

```
#### WSL Ubuntu Jammy JellyFish Linux Virtual Machine
`\etc\wsl.conf`
```
# Automatically mount Windows drive when the distribution is launched
[automount]

# Set to true will automount fixed drives (C:/ or D:/) with DrvFs under the root directory set above. Set to false means drives won't be mounted automatically, but need to be mounted manually or with fstab.
enabled = true

# Sets the directory where fixed drives will be automatically mounted. This example changes the mount location, so your C-drive would be /c, rather than the default /mnt/c.
root = /

# DrvFs-specific options can be specified.
options = "metadata,uid=1003,gid=1003,umask=077,fmask=11,case=off"

# Sets the `/etc/fstab` file to be processed when a WSL distribution is launched.
mountFsTab = true

# Network host settings that enable the DNS server used by WSL 2. This example changes the hostname, sets generateHosts to false, preventing WSL from the default behavior of auto-generating /etc/hosts, and sets generateResolvConf to false, preventing WSL from auto-generating /etc/resolv.conf, so that you can create your own (ie. nameserver 1.1.1.1).
[network]
hostname = DemoHost497686

generateHosts = false
generateResolvConf = false

# Set whether WSL supports interop process like launching Windows apps and adding path variables. Setting these to false will block the launch of Windows processes and block adding $PATH environment variables.
[interop]
enabled = false
appendWindowsPath = false

# Set the user when launching a distribution with WSL.
[user]
default = DemoUser

# Set a command to run when a new WSL instance launches. This example starts the Docker container service.
[boot]
command = service docker start

```
